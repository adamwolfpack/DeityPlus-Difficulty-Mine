# Deity+ Difficulty
A mod that contains a difficulty that's harder than the vanilla Deity difficulty.
	
## What the mod contains:
**Deity+ Difficulty**: the main content of the mod, this difficulty gives multiple reductions on player's progress 
while also advancing the AI's significantly. It's basically Deity on steroids.<br>
**Buffed ruins bonuses**: **Deity+** is pretty difficult by design, but that doesn't mean it has to be absolutely 
impossible, which is why there are ruins bonuses that are slightly buffed when **Deity+** is selected. This also 
means that AIs can also benefit from the buffed bonuses, so better explore and find the ruins fast!
